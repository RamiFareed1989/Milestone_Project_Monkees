# Milestone Project

## Introduction:

This is my first project using User Centric Frontend Development on my own!

Here I'm building a website for a band from the 60's called the **_Monkees_**. 

They want to show more presence again and gain more fans and they offer their services such as being booked for events and parties!


## Content of the Page

1. The first page contains:
+ The Navigation bar with the different pages 
+ The home page that i kept simple since it shows a nice picture of the band members
2. The second page contains:
+ The first part is talking about the Bio of the band all together with a picture of all 4
+ The second part shows the 4 different individuals with their pictures and their own Bios
3. The Thrid page contains:
+ A famous video of them with the title of it 
+ And 4 different famous songs of theirs
4. The fourth and last page contains:
+ The booking part with the submission form to contact them


## Features

I used the feature `html {scroll-behavior: smooth;}` to make scrolling throughout the page more smooth and user friendly and also used a collapsed navigation bar to make the site looks cleaner on all devices


## UX

My intention is to create a website that is easy to comprehend and also nice at the same time. I made sure that the reader has enough information about the monkees and how did they form back in the days.

I wanted to give a brief information about the type of music that the monkees provides and some songs as examples.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4.7

## Credits: 

I used for the **About** section [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) as a source to get the information about the **_Monkees_**

In the **Music** section i used `iFrame` element and implemented a youtube video of the **_Monkees_** official YouTube channel!
