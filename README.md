# Milestone Project

## Introduction:

This is my first project using User Centric Frontend Development on my own!

Here I'm building a website for a band from the 60's called the **_Monkees_**. 

They want to show more presence again and gain more fans and they offer their services such as being booked for events and parties!


## Content of the Page

1. The first page contains:
+ The Navigation bar with the different pages 
+ The home page that i kept simple since it shows a nice picture of the band members
2. The second page contains:
+ The first part is talking about the Bio of the band all together with a picture of all 4
+ The second part shows the 4 different individuals with their pictures and their own Bios
3. The Thrid page contains:
+ A famous video of them with the title of it 
+ And 4 different famous songs of theirs
4. The fourth and last page contains:
+ The booking part with the submission form to contact them
