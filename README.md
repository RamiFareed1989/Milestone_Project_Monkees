# Milestone Project

## Introduction:

This is my first project using User Centric Frontend Development on my own!

In this project I will be building a website for a band from the 60's that want to show more presence and gain more fans and at the same having the possiblity to be offer a sechdule online in case 
customers want to book them. 

The page will include several songs and pictures of the band!

I will be using Bootstrap as a help for my css but i will do use my own css codes!
